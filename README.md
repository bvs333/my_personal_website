The website gives a little introduction about myself.


index.html :-

This page is the introduction and the starting page of my website . I have added some styles in the css and some text display styles in Javascript .

I have used bootstrap for navigation bar for all the three pages in my website.

internships.html :- 

In this page I have used bootstrap for navigation bar and timeline . These are the basic templates provided by the bootstrap which I have used . I have added some text styling using css .

projects.html :-

The html page name is misleading , as I have mentioned about my education background here . Here also I have used bootstrap timeline and navigation bar.
